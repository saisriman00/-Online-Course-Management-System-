# Online Course Management System

This project is a simple Java console-based application developed as part of my learning and internship practice.  
It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Java Collections to manage courses and student enrollments.

The system allows an admin to create courses, register students, and enroll students into available courses through a menu-driven interface.
